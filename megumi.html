                <h2>Biography</h2>           
                <p>A childhood friend of Yuta Okkotsu who died tragically in a car crash in 2010, transforming into a cursed spirit bound to Yuta. Rika was taken in by her paternal grandmother, who believes that Rika killed her parents. Presently, she is one of the strongest cursed spirits in the Jujutsu Kaisen universe, and was dubbed “The Queen of Curses” by Suguru Geto. Rika’s mother died suddenly when she was 5. Two days before entering elementary school, Rika and her father got lost in the mountains while hiking. She was found alone by a camp near the summit. She met Yuta at the hospital, who was being treated for pneumonia. They then went to the same school.  JJHigh does not have a clear understanding of Rika’s origin, power, or potential.</p>
                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>Aware of her appearance, Rika sometimes manipulates adults. The ring she gave Yuta was stolen from her grandmother. In life, Rika was friendly with Yuta’s younger sister. After becoming a vengeful spirit, Rika became aggressive, which is why Yuta distanced himself from his family. She dislikes everyone but Yuta, and her least favorite thing is her grandmother’s stewed eggplant.</p>
